ðŸ“Š Water Consumption Prediction using Regression Models

This repository focuses on building and evaluating regression-based machine learning models to predict water consumption. With the increasing global demand for water resources, accurate forecasting plays a critical role in sustainable water management, planning, and policy-making.

ðŸ”Ž Key Features

Preprocessing of water consumption datasets (handling missing values, normalization, feature engineering).

Implementation of various regression models:

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Random Forest Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Gradient Boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)

Model evaluation with metrics such as RÂ² Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE.

Visualization of model performance and error distribution.

Comparative analysis to identify the best-performing regression model.
